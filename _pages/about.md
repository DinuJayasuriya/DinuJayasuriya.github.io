## Hi, I'm Dinu Jayasuriya

I'm a **PhD candidate at Clemson University** studying microbial communities across some of the most dynamic and extreme environments on Earth — from coastal marine sediments and estuaries to wildfire-scorched soils and freshwater systems.

What makes my work a little different is that I do **the whole thing** — I collect the samples in the field, process them in the wet lab, and analyze the data computationally. That full-pipeline perspective shapes how I think about every step of the research.

## 🔬 Research Focus

My research asks a fundamental question: **how do microbial communities respond to environmental change?**

I work across a broad range of ecosystems including marine and estuarine sediments, soil (including wildfire-affected systems), and freshwater environments. Using multi-omics approaches, I link microbial diversity to ecosystem-level processes — who is there, what they're doing, and how disturbance reshapes those communities over time.

**Current research themes:**
- Microbial community recovery following wildfire disturbance
- Cross-ecosystem comparison of microbial diversity (soil · water · marine)
- Linking community composition to functional potential
- Metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) recovery from complex environmental samples

## 🛠️ Core Expertise

**Field Work**
Sample design, collection and preservation across terrestrial, freshwater, estuarine and marine environments. I know what it takes to get a good sample before any lab work begins.

**Wet Lab**
DNA and RNA extraction, PCR, gel electrophoresis, library preparation, Qubit, Nanodrop, QuantIT, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, ITS sequencing, and whole metagenome sequencing.

**Bioinformatics**
Quality control, metagenomic assembly, binning, MAG quality assessment (CheckM), taxonomic classification (GTDB-Tk), functional annotation (Prokka, DRAM), and amplicon analysis (QIIME2/DADA2).

## 📖 This Blog

*From Field to Function* is a record of my research journey — written for anyone who wants to understand not just *how* to run a bioinformatics pipeline, but *why* the decisions made in the field and the wet lab matter for everything that comes after.

I post weekly, following my actual research workflow from sample collection through to final analysis. Each post includes real data, real commands, and real mistakes.

Whether you're a biologist curious about bioinformatics, or a computational person who has never held a soil core — this blog is for you.
